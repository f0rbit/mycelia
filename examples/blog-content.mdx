    <Essay id="lesson-show-your-work" title="Lesson 1: Show Off Your Work">
      Early in my career, I built many projects but rarely shared them publicly.
      This was a missed opportunity for feedback, networking, and career advancement.
      Building in public and sharing your work is one of the fastest ways to grow
      as a developer and connect with the community.
    </Essay>
    
    <Essay id="lesson-finish-projects" title="Lesson 2: Force Yourself To Finish">
      The temptation to jump to new, exciting projects before finishing the current
      one is strong, but completing projects teaches crucial skills: dealing with
      the "boring" parts, polishing details, and understanding what it really means
      to ship software to users.
    </Essay>
    
    <Essay id="lesson-stick-to-stack" title="Lesson 3: Stick to One Stack">
      While it's valuable to be aware of different technologies, constantly switching
      frameworks and languages prevents you from developing deep expertise. Pick
      a stack and master it before exploring alternatives.

      tutorials help solidify understanding and build your reputation.
    </Essay>
    
    <Essay id="lesson-community-engagement" title="Lesson 5: Engage with the Community">
      Programming can feel isolating, but the developer community is incredibly
      welcoming and helpful. Participating in forums, contributing to open source,
      and attending events accelerates learning and creates opportunities.

  ## Writing & Documentation Philosophy

  <Essay id="blogging-philosophy" title="Writing as Learning & Teaching">
    
    My approach to technical writing is rooted in the belief that writing about something
    is one of the best ways to truly understand it. When you have to explain a concept
    clearly to others, you're forced to examine your own understanding and fill in any gaps.
    
    <Research id="writing-learning-connection" type="reflection" status="ongoing">
      Exploring the connection between writing and learning, and how the process of

    <Note title="Documentation as Code">
      Good documentation should be treated with the same care and attention as code.
      It should be clear, maintainable, up-to-date, and provide real value to users.
    </Note>
    
    <Note title="Community Value">
      The most satisfying blog posts are those that solve real problems for other
      developers. Seeing comments from people who were helped by a tutorial or
      troubleshooting guide is incredibly rewarding.
