  A comprehensive timeline documenting my evolution from a curious 10-year-old discovering 
  Scratch to becoming a professional software developer. This journey spans over a decade
  of learning, building, and growing in the programming world.

  ## Early Foundations (2011-2018)

  <Experience id="scratch-beginning" title="First Steps with Scratch" 
              startDate="2011-10-09" endDate="2016-03-31" 
              type="learning" category="programming">
    
    My first baby steps into the programming world was with Scratch. This software was 
    installed on every computer at my school, and one of my friends had stumbled upon it 
    randomly, and I was instantly obsessed.
    
    <Skill name="Scratch" level="beginner" />
    <Skill name="Logic Programming" level="beginner" />
    <Skill name="Problem Solving" level="beginner" />
    
    <Note title="Key Learning">
      This was where I first discovered the magic of making computers do what I wanted them to do.
      The visual programming blocks made complex concepts accessible to a young mind.

  <Experience id="gamemaker-transition" title="Transition to GameMaker Studio"
              startDate="2016-03-31" endDate="2018-05-31"
              type="learning" category="game-development">
    
    From what I had learnt with my experimentation with Scratch, I was fascinated by the world 
    of game-dev, like a lot of young programmers. During school, a very helpful teacher suggested 
    that I try out GameMaker:Studio, as our school had secured a handful of licenses for 
    GameMaker:Studio 1.4, which was pretty new at the time.
    
    I was hesitant at first during the transition, it took me a while to get out of the blocky 
    dialect of Scratch and move to a more text-based scripting language (GameMaker Language). 
    After about a month I finally switched over, and had fallen in love with the enhanced 
    capabilities, performance, and workflow of GameMaker.

    <Achievement title="First Published Games">
      I spent these years creating little games for my friends and myself, finding that 
      programming was incredibly enjoyable, and even published some of these games online.

  <Experience id="minecraft-plugins" title="Minecraft Plugin Development"
              startDate="2017-12-31" endDate="2019-10-31"
              type="learning" category="backend-development">
    
    Throughout my childhood, there was one game I always came back to. I started playing 
    minecraft early in 2012, and I had tinkered around with minecraft servers, as I hosted 
    some in order to play with my friends. During this time I found plugins, and I felt like 
    such a hacker editing the configuration files.
    
    It wasn't long until my love for game-dev crossed paths with Minecraft, and I embarked 
    on a journey to create a dungeon-crawler within Minecraft, using plugins. At first, I was 
    using all pre-made plugins and attempting to configure them to throw together some experience 
    to share with others. Eventually, I found needs that couldn't be met with any existing plugins, 
    so I attempted to create my own.
    
    <Milestone title="First Real Programming Language">
      This was my first steps into the world of Java - my first "real" programming language.

  ## Deepening Skills (2018-2021)

  <Experience id="serious-game-dev" title="Serious Game Development"
              startDate="2018-05-31" endDate="2022-05-12"
              type="hobby" category="game-development">
    
    After having published a couple of my simple games with GameMaker on itch.io, and one of 
    them amassing 50,000 plays, I decided to take programming a bit more seriously. I had 
    purchased GameMaker Studio 2 with the money I had earnt from working at my local McDonald's, 
    and I set out to create any game that I could think of.
    
    Of course, like all motivation-fueled game-devs, I had a serious case of shiny object syndrome. 
    This meant that throughout my entire time making games, I had only managed to publish onto 
    itch.io about 5 of them. I had upwards of 30 projects that lay unfinished, however my 
    programming skills increased with each game, reinforcing and learning new programming patterns 
    so that each game was slightly better & cleaner than the last.
    
    <Achievement title="50,000 Plays">
      One of my early GameMaker games reached 50,000 plays on itch.io, giving me confidence
      to pursue programming more seriously.

    <Skill name="GameMaker Studio 2" level="advanced" />
    <Skill name="Game Design Patterns" level="intermediate" />
    <Skill name="Object-Oriented Programming" level="intermediate" />
    
    <Note title="Lessons Learned">
      While I suffered from "shiny object syndrome" and left many projects unfinished, each
      attempt taught me valuable programming patterns and improved my code quality.

              type="professional" category="service">
    
    During school and for my first couple years in University, I worked at McDonald's. I 
    enjoyed the high-pace environment, and the community at McDonald's, I managed to build 
    life-long friendships with my co-workers. I attained the role of Crew Trainer, and did 
    some professional development with the McDonald's office to improve my coaching ability, 
    which went hand-in-hand with my other job after school, Badminton Coach.

              type="learning" category="formal-education">
    
    I started studying Computer Science in 2021. I've always known - well at least since I 
    was 10 - that I wanted to be a programmer. My family was always very supportive of my 
    aspirations (my father especially, as he had already been working in this field for most 
    of his life).
    
    University has helped me to formalise my knowledge, and gain a deeper understanding of 
    the lower-level and foundations of programming. Before University, I only really felt 
    confident in a couple languages, the ones that I had spent years working with; but now 
    I believe I could pick up any new language within a day - and be able to write 
    professional-level code within a week.

              type="hobby" category="web-development">
    
    At the beginning of University, I found the programming courses relatively easy, so I 
    decided to start thinking about how I could earn some money off programming, as that was 
    my end goal - to be able to support myself by doing what I love.
    
    I did some market research (watching developer influencers on youtube), and decided that 
    front-end programming was pretty important in the workforce, and that was a sector of 
    programming that I had never indulged in. I felt confident enough in my backend skills - 
    due to my experience with Java and the development of my gm-server library, that I decided 
    the best course of action would be for me to just dip my toes in web-dev.
    
    Needless to say, I fell in love with the Web Development world, and it's become my 
    favourite area of programming.

    After my third semester of Uni, and coming out of my first successful tech job, I applied 
    to many junior positions in my city. I had learnt enough JavaScript & Java that I thought 
    I could land a part-time job over the semester break, and gain some work experience as well.
    
    Eventually, I managed to get a job for a local company, which has pretty large operations 
    but a relatively small software team. This job required me to learn PHP - a language that 
    I had never looked at, within 2 weeks. My skills & knowledge were put to the test, but I 
    managed to pick it up in the 2 weeks from the interview and when I started working, and 
    within my first week I had already pushed some code to the production servers.
    
    It was quite interesting moving from web-dev with React & NextJS to just using vanilla 
    PHP and JavaScript, no frameworks. This meant we basically had our own hand-rolled 
    solutions for everything.

           status="completed" category="open-source">
    
    After rewriting my Minecraft dungeon-crawler server & plugins twice, I had grown quite 
    comfortable with the Java eco-system, and I set out to make my first large-scale project 
    (library). While fooling around with Game Development, I grew a keen interest in multiplayer 
    games, and since all my games were developed with GameMaker, I wanted an easy way to be 
    able to manage larger-scale multiplayer games.
    
    The project was to write a Java Library that would be able to easily interact with GameMaker 
    clients, and operate as a game server for multiplayer games. This project grew my skillset 
    very quickly, and I got my first taste of deploying a coding project & the open-source workflow.

  <Note title="Reflection on Growth">
    Looking back on this journey, I'm amazed at how each experience built upon the last.
    From the visual blocks of Scratch to professional software development, every step
    taught me something valuable about programming, problem-solving, and building things
    that matter.
