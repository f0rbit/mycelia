# Introduction to Mycelia

Welcome to Mycelia - a revolutionary approach to knowledge management that transforms your markdown into a living, interconnected knowledge graph.

## What is Mycelia?

Mycelia is a **semantic content framework** that extends MDX with custom tags designed for knowledge management. It automatically builds a queryable graph from your content, enabling powerful navigation, discovery, and visualization of your ideas.

### Key Features

- üå≤ **Forest Metaphor**: Organize knowledge organically using Trunks, Branches, and Leafs
- üè∑Ô∏è **Custom Tags**: Semantic HTML tags for people, projects, tasks, and more
- üîó **Auto-linking**: Automatic relationship detection and graph building
- üìä **Graph Visualization**: Interactive force-directed graphs of your knowledge
- ‚ö° **Static Generation**: Full static site generation with Next.js
- üé® **Semantic Rendering**: Type-specific components for beautiful display

## Why Mycelia?

### The Problem with Traditional Note-Taking

Traditional note-taking tools treat each note as an isolated document. Even with folders and tags, discovering connections between ideas requires manual work. As your knowledge base grows, important relationships get lost in the noise.

### The Mycelia Solution

Mycelia treats your knowledge as a **living ecosystem**:

```mdx
<Person name="Alan Kay">
  Inventor of object-oriented programming
  <Skill>Smalltalk</Skill>
  <Skill>User Interface Design</Skill>
</Person>

<Project title="Dynabook Concept">
  Alan Kay's vision for personal computing
  Inspired by <Person name="Alan Kay" />
  <Tag>computing-history</Tag>
</Project>

<Essay title="The Future We Lost">
  Exploring unrealized potential from the Dynabook era
  References <Project title="Dynabook Concept" />
  <Tag>computing-history</Tag>
</Essay>
```

Mycelia automatically:
- Creates nodes for each Person, Project, and Essay
- Establishes relationships between them
- Builds indexes for fast queries
- Enables graph traversal and visualization

## Core Concepts

### 1. Semantic Structure

Instead of generic markdown, use semantic tags that carry meaning:

```mdx
<!-- Traditional Markdown -->
## John Doe
Senior Engineer at Acme Corp
Skills: Python, Docker, Kubernetes

<!-- Mycelia Semantic Tags -->
<Person name="John Doe" role="Senior Engineer">
  Works at <Organization>Acme Corp</Organization>
  <Skill level="expert">Python</Skill>
  <Skill level="advanced">Docker</Skill>
  <Skill level="intermediate">Kubernetes</Skill>
</Person>
```

### 2. Automatic Relationships

Mycelia detects and creates three types of relationships:

- **Contains**: Parent-child hierarchies
- **References**: Explicit connections between nodes
- **Relates**: Implicit connections through shared attributes

### 3. Knowledge Graph

Your content becomes a queryable graph:

```typescript
// Find all projects by a person
graph.query()
  .from('person', 'jane-smith')
  .through('authored')
  .to('project')
  .execute()

// Find related content by tags
graph.query()
  .tagged('machine-learning')
  .type('project', 'research')
  .execute()
```

## Use Cases

### üìö Digital Garden
Build a public knowledge garden where ideas grow and interconnect naturally.

### üíº Project Documentation
Track projects with automatic task aggregation, team member connections, and timeline visualization.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Team Knowledge Base
Create a shared brain for your team with expertise mapping and knowledge discovery.

### üìñ Research Notes
Organize research with automatic citation graphs and topic clustering.

### üé® Creative Portfolio
Showcase work with automatic project galleries and skill matrices.

## How It Works

1. **Write** content using Mycelia's semantic tags
2. **Parse** MDX files into a knowledge graph
3. **Query** the graph for connections and insights
4. **Render** with type-specific React components
5. **Deploy** as a static site with Next.js

## Quick Example

Here's a complete Mycelia document:

```mdx filename="my-knowledge.mdx"
---
title: My Knowledge Garden
---

<Person name="Me" role="Knowledge Gardener">
  Building my second brain with Mycelia
  
  <Skill>Writing</Skill>
  <Skill>Programming</Skill>
  <Skill>Design</Skill>
</Person>

<Project title="Learning Mycelia" status="in-progress">
  <Task status="done">Read documentation</Task>
  <Task status="done">Install packages</Task>
  <Task>Build first knowledge graph</Task>
  
  <Note>
    Mycelia makes it easy to connect ideas!
  </Note>
</Project>

<Essay title="Why Knowledge Graphs Matter">
  Traditional note-taking creates silos...
  
  <Tag>knowledge-management</Tag>
  <Tag>productivity</Tag>
</Essay>
```

This automatically creates:
- 1 Person node
- 1 Project node with 3 Task children
- 1 Essay node
- 2 Tag connections
- All necessary relationships

## Philosophy

Mycelia is inspired by:

- **Zettelkasten**: Interconnected atomic notes
- **Digital Gardens**: Public learning and growing ideas
- **Graph Databases**: Relationship-first data modeling
- **Semantic Web**: Meaningful, machine-readable content

We believe knowledge should be:
- **Interconnected**: Ideas don't exist in isolation
- **Discoverable**: Serendipitous connections lead to insights
- **Evolving**: Knowledge grows and changes over time
- **Shareable**: Learning in public benefits everyone

Welcome to the future of knowledge management. Welcome to Mycelia. üå±
