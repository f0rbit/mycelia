# Mycelia Documentation

Welcome to the Mycelia documentation! Mycelia is a powerful markdown-based engine for creating deeply-linked project websites, also known as digital gardens.

## What is Mycelia?

Mycelia transforms your markdown content with custom tags into a fully interconnected knowledge graph. It's designed for:

- **Digital Gardens**: Create rich, interconnected knowledge bases
- **Project Documentation**: Document complex projects with deep relationships
- **Portfolio Sites**: Showcase work with semantic relationships
- **Research Notes**: Organize research with cross-references

## Core Concepts

Mycelia uses a forest metaphor to organize content:

- **🍃 Leafs**: Individual pieces of content (blog posts, notes, essays)
- **🌿 Branches**: Collections that contain leafs (projects, topics)
- **🌳 Trunks**: Main entities (people, organizations)
- **🌲 Forest**: The complete interconnected knowledge graph

## Quick Example

```mdx
<Project name="My Project" status="active">
  <Skill>TypeScript</Skill>
  <Task status="completed">Build parser</Task>
  
  Built with <Person id="john">John Doe</Person>
  
  <Tag>open-source</Tag>
</Project>
```

This creates nodes for the project, skill, task, person, and tag - all automatically linked in the knowledge graph!
