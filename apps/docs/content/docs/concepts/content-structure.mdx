# Content Structure

Mycelia uses a forest metaphor to organize and connect your knowledge. This organic structure allows for natural growth and interconnection of ideas.

## The Forest Metaphor

Your knowledge base is structured like a living forest, organized by node types and relationships.

## Node Primitives

Mycelia uses three core primitive types:

### Content Nodes
Content-bearing nodes that can have children and nested structure:

- **Projects**: Work projects, personal initiatives
- **People**: Individuals, collaborators, authors  
- **Organizations**: Companies, institutions, groups
- **Posts**: Blog articles, essays, thoughts
- **Research**: Study topics, investigation areas
- **Skills**: Competencies and expertise
- **Tasks**: Action items, todo items

```mdx
<Project title="AI Research Assistant" status="active">
  Building an AI-powered research tool
  
  <Task>Implement vector search</Task>
  <Task>Add citation management</Task>
</Project>

<Person name="Jane Smith" role="ML Engineer">
  Expert in transformer architectures
  <Skill>PyTorch</Skill>
  <Skill>NLP</Skill>
</Person>
```

### Reference Nodes
Links and pointers to other nodes:

```mdx
<Post>
  Inspired by <Person name="Jane Smith" />
</Post>
```

### Meta Nodes
Annotations and tags about content:

```mdx
<Project>
  <Tag>machine-learning</Tag>
  <Tag>productivity</Tag>
</Project>
```

## Relationships & Connections

Mycelia automatically creates edges (relationships) between nodes:

### 1. Contains
Parent-child relationships within nested content:

```mdx
<Project id="proj-1"> <!-- Parent -->
  <Task>...</Task> <!-- Child -->
  <Note>...</Note> <!-- Child -->
</Project>
```

Creates edges: `{ from: "proj-1", to: "task-id", type: "contains" }`

### 2. References
Explicit connections between nodes:

```mdx
<Post id="post-1">
  Inspired by <Person name="Jane Smith" />
  Related to <Project title="AI Research" />
</Post>
```

Creates edges with `type: "references"`

### 3. Mentions
When content mentions other entities:

```mdx
<Essay>
  This essay discusses <Person name="Alan Kay" />
</Essay>
```

Creates edges with `type: "mentions"`

### 4. Tags
Connections through tag associations:

```mdx
<Post><Tag>machine-learning</Tag></Post>
<Project><Tag>machine-learning</Tag></Project>
```

Creates edges with `type: "tags"`

## Content Organization

### Directory Structure

Organize your content files logically:

```
content/
├── posts/
│   ├── 2024-01-15-neural-networks.mdx
│   └── 2024-02-01-attention-mechanism.mdx
├── projects/
│   ├── ai-assistant.mdx
│   └── knowledge-graph.mdx
├── people/
│   ├── collaborators.mdx
│   └── mentors.mdx
└── index.mdx
```

### Metadata & Frontmatter

Use frontmatter for document-level metadata:

```mdx
---
title: Building a Second Brain
date: 2024-01-15
author: John Doe
tags: [productivity, knowledge-management]
status: published
---

# Content starts here...
```

### Nesting & Hierarchy

Create natural hierarchies through nesting:

```mdx
<Research topic="Machine Learning">
  <Paper title="Attention Is All You Need">
    <Note>Transformer architecture breakthrough</Note>
    <Note>Self-attention mechanism</Note>
  </Paper>
  
  <Experiment name="Fine-tuning BERT">
    <Result>85% accuracy on sentiment analysis</Result>
  </Experiment>
</Research>
```

## Graph Structure

Mycelia builds a knowledge graph stored as JSON:

### Nodes
Each tag becomes a node with:
- Unique ID (auto-generated or explicit)
- Type (person, project, task, etc.)
- Primitive (Content, Reference, or Meta)
- Attributes (from tag attributes)
- Content (nested text/MDX)
- Children (IDs of nested nodes)

```typescript
interface ContentNode {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  primitive: 'Content';
  title?: string;
  content?: string;
  children: string[];
  attributes: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Edges
Connections between nodes:
- From node ID
- To node ID
- Edge type (contains, references, mentions, tags)
- Optional attributes

```typescript
interface MyceliaEdge {
  id: string;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  type: 'contains' | 'references' | 'mentions' | 'tags' | 'collaborates';
  attributes?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Indexes
Fast lookups by:
- Type: `indexes.byType['person']` → list of person node IDs
- Tag: `indexes.byTag['ml']` → nodes tagged with 'ml'
- Primitive: `indexes.byPrimitive['Content']` → all content nodes
- Source file: `indexes.bySource['content/blog.mdx']` → nodes from file

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Core Entities
Define your main entities first:
- Key people in your network
- Main projects or areas
- Organizations you work with

### 2. Build Natural Hierarchies
Let structure emerge from your content:
- Nest tasks within projects
- Group skills within people
- Organize content by topic

### 3. Connect Everything
Make relationships explicit:
- Tag consistently for discoverability
- Reference people and projects explicitly
- Link related content together

### 4. Maintain Balance
- Don't over-nest (3-4 levels max)
- Keep individual files focused
- Split large documents into smaller ones

## Example: Personal Knowledge Base

```mdx
<!-- content/index.mdx -->
<Forest name="My Digital Garden">
  <Person name="Me" role="Knowledge Gardener">
    <Skill>Writing</Skill>
    <Skill>Programming</Skill>
  </Person>
  
  <Project title="Learning AI" status="ongoing">
    <Task status="done">Complete CS231n</Task>
    <Task>Build first neural network</Task>
    <Resource url="https://arxiv.org/">Papers</Resource>
  </Project>
  
  <Collection name="Reading List">
    <Book title="Thinking, Fast and Slow" author="Kahneman" />
    <Book title="The Pragmatic Programmer" />
  </Collection>
</Forest>
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Cross-References
Create rich interconnections:

```mdx
<Post id="post-1">
  See also <Post idref="post-2" />
</Post>
```

### Temporal Organization
Track evolution over time:

```mdx
<Project>
  <Phase date="2024-Q1">Planning</Phase>
  <Phase date="2024-Q2">Implementation</Phase>
</Project>
```

### Hierarchical Tags
Organize tags taxonomically:

```mdx
<Tag>programming</Tag>
<Tag>programming/python</Tag>
<Tag>programming/python/django</Tag>
```
