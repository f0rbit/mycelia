# Content Structure

Mycelia uses a forest metaphor to organize and connect your knowledge. This organic structure allows for natural growth and interconnection of ideas.

## The Forest Metaphor

Your knowledge base is structured like a living forest:

```
🌲 Forest (Your entire knowledge base)
├── 🌳 Trunks (Core entities: People, Organizations)
├── 🌿 Branches (Collections: Projects, Research areas)
└── 🍃 Leafs (Individual pieces: Posts, Notes, Tasks)
```

## Core Primitives

### Leafs 🍃
Individual pieces of content that form the foundation of your knowledge:

- **Posts**: Blog articles, essays, thoughts
- **Notes**: Quick observations, meeting notes
- **Tasks**: Action items, todo items
- **References**: Links, citations, bookmarks

```mdx
<Post title="Understanding Neural Networks">
  My exploration into deep learning fundamentals...
</Post>

<Note>
  Remember to review the paper on attention mechanisms
</Note>
```

### Branches 🌿
Collections that group and organize related content:

- **Projects**: Work projects, personal initiatives
- **Research**: Study topics, investigation areas
- **Collections**: Curated lists, galleries

```mdx
<Project title="AI Research Assistant" status="active">
  Building an AI-powered research tool
  
  <Task>Implement vector search</Task>
  <Task>Add citation management</Task>
</Project>
```

### Trunks 🌳
Core entities that everything else connects to:

- **People**: Individuals, collaborators, authors
- **Organizations**: Companies, institutions, groups
- **Themes**: Major topics, life areas

```mdx
<Person name="Jane Smith" role="ML Engineer">
  Expert in transformer architectures
  <Skill>PyTorch</Skill>
  <Skill>NLP</Skill>
</Person>
```

## Relationships & Connections

Mycelia automatically creates three types of relationships:

### 1. Contains
Parent-child relationships within the content tree:

```mdx
<Project> <!-- Parent -->
  <Task>...</Task> <!-- Child -->
  <Note>...</Note> <!-- Child -->
</Project>
```

### 2. References
Explicit connections between nodes:

```mdx
<Post>
  Inspired by <Person name="Jane Smith" />
  Related to <Project title="AI Research" />
</Post>
```

### 3. Relates
Implicit connections through shared tags or attributes:

```mdx
<!-- These will be automatically related -->
<Post><Tag>machine-learning</Tag></Post>
<Project><Tag>machine-learning</Tag></Project>
```

## Content Organization

### Directory Structure

Organize your content files logically:

```
content/
├── posts/
│   ├── 2024-01-15-neural-networks.mdx
│   └── 2024-02-01-attention-mechanism.mdx
├── projects/
│   ├── ai-assistant.mdx
│   └── knowledge-graph.mdx
├── people/
│   ├── collaborators.mdx
│   └── mentors.mdx
└── index.mdx
```

### Metadata & Frontmatter

Use frontmatter for document-level metadata:

```mdx
---
title: Building a Second Brain
date: 2024-01-15
author: John Doe
tags: [productivity, knowledge-management]
status: published
---

# Content starts here...
```

### Nesting & Hierarchy

Create natural hierarchies through nesting:

```mdx
<Research topic="Machine Learning">
  <Paper title="Attention Is All You Need">
    <Note>Transformer architecture breakthrough</Note>
    <Note>Self-attention mechanism</Note>
  </Paper>
  
  <Experiment name="Fine-tuning BERT">
    <Result>85% accuracy on sentiment analysis</Result>
  </Experiment>
</Research>
```

## Graph Structure

Mycelia builds a knowledge graph from your content:

### Nodes
Each tag becomes a node with:
- Unique ID (auto-generated)
- Type (leaf, branch, trunk)
- Properties (from attributes)
- Content (nested text/MDX)

### Edges
Connections between nodes:
- From node ID
- To node ID
- Relationship type
- Weight/strength

### Indexes
Fast lookups by:
- Type (all projects, all people)
- Tag (all items with #ml)
- Date (temporal navigation)
- Relationship (who knows whom)

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Trunks
Define your core entities first:
- Key people in your network
- Main projects or areas
- Central themes

### 2. Grow Branches Naturally
Let collections emerge from your content:
- Group related posts into projects
- Collect research notes by topic
- Organize tasks by goal

### 3. Connect Everything
Make relationships explicit:
- Tag liberally but consistently
- Reference people and projects
- Link related content

### 4. Maintain Balance
- Don't over-nest (3-4 levels max)
- Keep individual files focused
- Split large topics into sub-topics

## Example: Personal Knowledge Base

```mdx
<!-- content/index.mdx -->
<Forest name="My Digital Garden">
  <Person name="Me" role="Knowledge Gardener">
    <Skill>Writing</Skill>
    <Skill>Programming</Skill>
  </Person>
  
  <Project title="Learning AI" status="ongoing">
    <Task status="done">Complete CS231n</Task>
    <Task>Build first neural network</Task>
    <Resource url="https://arxiv.org/">Papers</Resource>
  </Project>
  
  <Collection name="Reading List">
    <Book title="Thinking, Fast and Slow" author="Kahneman" />
    <Book title="The Pragmatic Programmer" />
  </Collection>
</Forest>
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Cross-References
Create rich interconnections:

```mdx
<Post id="post-1">
  See also <Post idref="post-2" />
</Post>
```

### Temporal Organization
Track evolution over time:

```mdx
<Project>
  <Phase date="2024-Q1">Planning</Phase>
  <Phase date="2024-Q2">Implementation</Phase>
</Project>
```

### Hierarchical Tags
Organize tags taxonomically:

```mdx
<Tag>programming</Tag>
<Tag>programming/python</Tag>
<Tag>programming/python/django</Tag>
```
