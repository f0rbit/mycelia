        "content": "A comprehensive timeline documenting my evolution from a curious 10-year-old discovering Scratch to becoming a professional software developer. This journey spans over a decade of learning, building, and growing in the programming world.Early Foundations (2011-2018)My first baby steps into the programming world was with Scratch. This software was installed on every computer at my school, and one of my friends had stumbled upon it randomly, and I was instantly obsessed.This was where I first discovered the magic of making computers do what I wanted them to do. The visual programming blocks made complex concepts accessible to a young mind.From what I had learnt with my experimentation with Scratch, I was fascinated by the world of game-dev, like a lot of young programmers. During school, a very helpful teacher suggested that I try out GameMaker:Studio, as our school had secured a handful of licenses for GameMaker:Studio 1.4, which was pretty new at the time.I was hesitant at first during the transition, it took me a while to get out of the blocky dialect of Scratch and move to a more text-based scripting language (GameMaker Language). After about a month I finally switched over, and had fallen in love with the enhanced capabilities, performance, and workflow of GameMaker.I spent these years creating little games for my friends and myself, finding that programming was incredibly enjoyable, and even published some of these games online.Throughout my childhood, there was one game I always came back to. I started playing minecraft early in 2012, and I had tinkered around with minecraft servers, as I hosted some in order to play with my friends. During this time I found plugins, and I felt like such a hacker editing the configuration files.It wasn't long until my love for game-dev crossed paths with Minecraft, and I embarked on a journey to create a dungeon-crawler within Minecraft, using plugins. At first, I was using all pre-made plugins and attempting to configure them to throw together some experience to share with others. Eventually, I found needs that couldn't be met with any existing plugins, so I attempted to create my own.This was my first steps into the world of Java - my first \"real\" programming language.A complex dungeon-crawler experience built entirely within Minecraft using custom plugins. This project taught me the fundamentals of Java programming and server-side development.Deepening Skills (2018-2021)After having published a couple of my simple games with GameMaker on itch.io, and one of them amassing 50,000 plays, I decided to take programming a bit more seriously. I had purchased GameMaker Studio 2 with the money I had earnt from working at my local McDonald's, and I set out to create any game that I could think of.Of course, like all motivation-fueled game-devs, I had a serious case of shiny object syndrome. This meant that throughout my entire time making games, I had only managed to publish onto itch.io about 5 of them. I had upwards of 30 projects that lay unfinished, however my programming skills increased with each game, reinforcing and learning new programming patterns so that each game was slightly better & cleaner than the last.One of my early GameMaker games reached 50,000 plays on itch.io, giving me confidence to pursue programming more seriously.While I suffered from \"shiny object syndrome\" and left many projects unfinished, each attempt taught me valuable programming patterns and improved my code quality.Professional Development (2019-Present)During school and for my first couple years in University, I worked at McDonald's. I enjoyed the high-pace environment, and the community at McDonald's, I managed to build life-long friendships with my co-workers. I attained the role of Crew Trainer, and did some professional development with the McDonald's office to improve my coaching ability, which went hand-in-hand with my other job after school, Badminton Coach.Advanced to Crew Trainer role with professional development training from McDonald's corporate.I started studying Computer Science in 2021. I've always known - well at least since I was 10 - that I wanted to be a programmer. My family was always very supportive of my aspirations (my father especially, as he had already been working in this field for most of his life).University has helped me to formalise my knowledge, and gain a deeper understanding of the lower-level and foundations of programming. Before University, I only really felt confident in a couple languages, the ones that I had spent years working with; but now I believe I could pick up any new language within a day - and be able to write professional-level code within a week.My father, already working in the tech field, provided invaluable guidance and support throughout my programming journey.At the beginning of University, I found the programming courses relatively easy, so I decided to start thinking about how I could earn some money off programming, as that was my end goal - to be able to support myself by doing what I love.I did some market research (watching developer influencers on youtube), and decided that front-end programming was pretty important in the workforce, and that was a sector of programming that I had never indulged in. I felt confident enough in my backend skills - due to my experience with Java and the development of my gm-server library, that I decided the best course of action would be for me to just dip my toes in web-dev.Needless to say, I fell in love with the Web Development world, and it's become my favourite area of programming.Web development became my primary focus and favorite area of programming, shifting my career trajectory toward full-stack web development.After my third semester of Uni, and coming out of my first successful tech job, I applied to many junior positions in my city. I had learnt enough JavaScript & Java that I thought I could land a part-time job over the semester break, and gain some work experience as well.Eventually, I managed to get a job for a local company, which has pretty large operations but a relatively small software team. This job required me to learn PHP - a language that I had never looked at, within 2 weeks. My skills & knowledge were put to the test, but I managed to pick it up in the 2 weeks from the interview and when I started working, and within my first week I had already pushed some code to the production servers.It was quite interesting moving from web-dev with React & NextJS to just using vanilla PHP and JavaScript, no frameworks. This meant we basically had our own hand-rolled solutions for everything.Learned PHP from scratch in 2 weeks and deployed production code within the first week of employment.Working without frameworks taught me to appreciate the fundamentals and understand what modern frameworks provide under the hood.Major Projects & MilestonesAfter rewriting my Minecraft dungeon-crawler server & plugins twice, I had grown quite comfortable with the Java eco-system, and I set out to make my first large-scale project (library). While fooling around with Game Development, I grew a keen interest in multiplayer games, and since all my games were developed with GameMaker, I wanted an easy way to be able to manage larger-scale multiplayer games.The project was to write a Java Library that would be able to easily interact with GameMaker clients, and operate as a game server for multiplayer games. This project grew my skillset very quickly, and I got my first taste of deploying a coding project & the open-source workflow.This was my introduction to open source development, proper documentation, and building tools for other developers to use.Looking back on this journey, I'm amazed at how each experience built upon the last. From the visual blocks of Scratch to professional software development, every step taught me something valuable about programming, problem-solving, and building things that matter.Time spent documenting and reflecting on this incredible journey",

Theoretical knowledge without practical application quickly fades, while concepts learned through building persist.Writing about what you learn - whether in blog posts, documentation, or personal notes - significantly improves retention and understanding. Teaching others is one of the best ways to learn.Regularly revisiting concepts and technologies prevents knowledge decay. Maintaining a learning journal helps identify areas that need reinforcement.Participating in developer communities, forums, and open source projects provides exposure to different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.Maintained a regular learning schedule for over 3 years, dedicating time weekly to exploring new technologies and deepening existing knowledge.",

This post resonates with developers at all stages of their careers.Analyzed common patterns in developer career progression, both from personal experience and by observing other developers' journeys in the community.Early in my career, I built many projects but rarely shared them publicly. This was a missed opportunity for feedback, networking, and career advancement. Building in public and sharing your work is one of the fastest ways to grow as a developer and connect with the community.The temptation to jump to new, exciting projects before finishing the current one is strong, but completing projects teaches crucial skills: dealing with the \"boring\" parts, polishing details, and understanding what it really means to ship software to users.While it's valuable to be aware of different technologies, constantly switching frameworks and languages prevents you from developing deep expertise. Pick a stack and master it before exploring alternatives.Writing about what you learn reinforces the knowledge and creates a valuable resource for your future self and other developers. Blog posts, notes, and tutorials help solidify understanding and build your reputation.Programming can feel isolating, but the developer community is incredibly welcoming and helpful. Participating in forums, contributing to open source, and attending events accelerates learning and creates opportunities.This post gained significant traction in the developer community and sparked discussions about career development strategies across multiple platforms.Some of the most valuable content comes from honest reflection on mistakes and lessons learned. Vulnerability in sharing struggles helps other developers feel less alone in their journey.Project Development LogsA multi-part blog series documenting the development, redesign, and evolution of DevPad - a minimalistic project management tool for developers. This series provides transparency into the development process and design decisions.Following on from my last update, the new redesign is coming along nicely, along with finally implementing some of the core functionality. Future plans to open source part of the application are described, and a roadmap for initial release is laid out.Implemented the fundamental features: project creation, task management, and basic time trackingPlanning which parts of the application to open source and how to structure the codebase for community contributionsRegular development updates help maintain accountability and allow the community to follow along with the design and implementation decisions.It's been a while since I've worked on devpad, and I've forgotten exactly how the system is setup. Trying to use this application has brought to life many limitations of the hyper-minimalist vanilla html feel.Explored the tension between minimalist design principles and practical usability, finding the right balance between simplicity and functionality.Enhanced the interface while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic, focusing on clarity and user experienceSometimes taking a break from a project provides valuable perspective on its strengths and weaknesses. Fresh eyes often reveal obvious improvements.After running into some issues synchronising the session across 2 different servers, I rethink why I have these servers split up in the first place.Analyzed the complexity introduced by splitting the application across multiple servers and evaluated whether the separation was providing real benefits.Consolidated the application architecture to reduce complexity and eliminate session synchronization issuesSometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. Premature optimization and over-engineering can create problems that don't need to exist.Language & Framework ExplorationA two-part series documenting the transition of a project from JavaScript to TypeScript, exploring the practical benefits and challenges of adopting static typing.In this log, I'll delve into specific coding challenges and solutions encountered while developing the todo-tracker in vanilla JavaScript.Explored modern JavaScript patterns, module systems, and state management approaches without relying on frameworks or build tools.Designed a clean, maintainable architecture using only JavaScript language features and web APIsBuilding without frameworks forces you to understand the underlying web platform and browser APIs, providing valuable insights into what frameworks do for you.As part of the todo-tracker project, I transitioned the project from JavaScript to TypeScript, documenting the process, challenges, and benefits discovered along the way.Researched best practices for migrating existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript, including incremental adoption strategies and tooling setup.Systematically added type annotations, interfaces, and type safety throughout the codebase while maintaining functionalityThe migration caught several potential bugs and made the codebase significantly more maintainable and self-documenting.The transition to TypeScript was smoother than expected and provided immediate benefits in terms of code quality and developer experience.Community Contributions & Open SourceA while ago I started a large-scale project that I intended to be able to use myself to manage both my coding projects & university assignments. This post documents the decision to significantly reduce scope and focus on core functionality.Analyzed how feature creep and scope expansion had made the project unwieldy and difficult to complete, leading to the decision to dramatically simplify.Identified the core 20% of features that would provide 80% of the value and eliminated everything else from the initial releaseLearning to say \"no\" to features and focus on the essential functionality is one of the most important skills for completing projects successfully.Writing & Documentation PhilosophyMy approach to technical writing is rooted in the belief that writing about something is one of the best ways to truly understand it. When you have to explain a concept clearly to others, you're forced to examine your own understanding and fill in any gaps.Exploring the connection between writing and learning, and how the process of articulating ideas helps solidify understanding and reveal knowledge gaps.Good documentation should be treated with the same care and attention as code. It should be clear, maintainable, up-to-date, and provide real value to users.The most satisfying blog posts are those that solve real problems for other developers. Seeing comments from people who were helped by a tutorial or troubleshooting guide is incredibly rewarding.Explore how AI coding assistants are changing the development process and document best practices for integrating them effectivelyCreate a comprehensive series on web performance, from measurement to optimization techniques across different aspects of web applicationsWrite about maintaining mental health, avoiding burnout, and creating sustainable practices in a demanding field like software developmentFuture content will continue to focus on practical solutions to real problems, combined with honest reflection on the development process and career growth.Time spent organizing and documenting blog content and writing philosophy",
