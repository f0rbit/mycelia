## How This Site Works

1. **Content Discovery**: MDX files in `content/` are automatically discovered
2. **Route Generation**: File paths become URL routes (e.g., `content/blog/post.mdx` â†’ `/blog/post`)
3. **Parsing**: Each MDX file is parsed to extract semantic relationships
4. **Rendering**: Clean, professional components render the content
5. **Linking**: References between content create automatic bidirectional links

The site you're viewing right now demonstrates this entire pipeline in action!

<Person id="demo-user">You</Person> are experiencing the result of this seamless integration. Every link and relationship you see was automatically generated from the content structure.
