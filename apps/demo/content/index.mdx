  My first Mycelia project! This demonstrates how semantic tags create structured nodes in your knowledge graph.
  
  <Task id="learn-basics" priority="high">
    Learn how Mycelia parses semantic tags like Project, Task, Person, and Essay into a knowledge graph.
  </Task>
  
  <Task id="build-something" priority="medium">
    Build my own knowledge base using Mycelia's simple but powerful syntax.
  </Task>
  
  <Task id="explore-graph" priority="low">
    Explore how nodes connect to each other through parent-child relationships and cross-references.
  </Task>
</Project>

## What You'll Learn

- How to use semantic tags like `<Project>`, `<Person>`, `<Task>`, and `<Essay>`
- How content gets automatically parsed into a knowledge graph
- How to create relationships between nodes
- How Mycelia makes your content explorable and interconnected
