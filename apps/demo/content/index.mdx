# Welcome to My Mycelia Knowledge Base

This is a demonstration of **Mycelia** - a powerful system that transforms your MDX files into an interconnected knowledge graph with beautiful, clean rendering.

<Collection id="main-content" title="Main Content">
  Every piece of content in this site is automatically discovered from the `content/` folder and rendered with relationships preserved.
</Collection>

## How It Works

1. **Drop MDX files** into the `content/` folder (with any nested structure)
2. **Use Mycelia tags** like `<Project>`, `<Essay>`, `<Person>` to create semantic structure  
3. **Reference other content** and Mycelia automatically creates bidirectional links
4. **Get a beautiful site** with clean rendering, graph visualization, and zero configuration

## Features
