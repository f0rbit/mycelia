# About This Demo

<Person id="demo-author" name="Mycelia Team">
  This demo was created by the Mycelia team to showcase the basics of building interconnected knowledge graphs from markdown content.
  
  We believe documentation, notes, and content should be more than static files - they should be explorable networks of knowledge.

## What This Demo Shows

This simple demo includes roughly 15-20 pages of interconnected content demonstrating:

### Core Features
- **Semantic tag parsing** - `<Project>`, `<Task>`, `<Person>`, `<Essay>`, `<Skill>` and more
- **Automatic graph generation** - Your content becomes a queryable knowledge graph
- **Parent-child relationships** - Nested tags create automatic hierarchies
- **Cross-references** - Link between nodes anywhere in your content
- **Type-based organization** - Filter and navigate by content type

### Why Mycelia?

Traditional content management treats each page as isolated. Mycelia recognizes that knowledge is interconnected:

- A **Project** contains **Tasks**
- A **Person** has **Skills** 
- An **Essay** references other **Essays**
- Everything links together naturally

## Architecture

Mycelia is built with three core packages:

- `@mycelia/parser` - Parses MDX files into a knowledge graph
- `@mycelia/core` - Graph data structures and utilities
- `@mycelia/render` - React components for rendering content

All working together to make your content come alive.
