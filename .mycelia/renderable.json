        "content": "A comprehensive timeline documenting my evolution from a curious 10-year-old discovering\nScratch to becoming a professional software developer. This journey spans over a decade\nof learning, building, and growing in the programming world.Early Foundations (2011-2018)My first baby steps into the programming world was with Scratch. This software was\ninstalled on every computer at my school, and one of my friends had stumbled upon it\nrandomly, and I was instantly obsessed.This was where I first discovered the magic of making computers do what I wanted them to do.\nThe visual programming blocks made complex concepts accessible to a young mind.From what I had learnt with my experimentation with Scratch, I was fascinated by the world\nof game-dev, like a lot of young programmers. During school, a very helpful teacher suggested\nthat I try out GameMaker:Studio, as our school had secured a handful of licenses for\nGameMaker:Studio 1.4, which was pretty new at the time.I was hesitant at first during the transition, it took me a while to get out of the blocky\ndialect of Scratch and move to a more text-based scripting language (GameMaker Language).\nAfter about a month I finally switched over, and had fallen in love with the enhanced\ncapabilities, performance, and workflow of GameMaker.I spent these years creating little games for my friends and myself, finding that\nprogramming was incredibly enjoyable, and even published some of these games online.Throughout my childhood, there was one game I always came back to. I started playing\nminecraft early in 2012, and I had tinkered around with minecraft servers, as I hosted\nsome in order to play with my friends. During this time I found plugins, and I felt like\nsuch a hacker editing the configuration files.It wasn't long until my love for game-dev crossed paths with Minecraft, and I embarked\non a journey to create a dungeon-crawler within Minecraft, using plugins. At first, I was\nusing all pre-made plugins and attempting to configure them to throw together some experience\nto share with others. Eventually, I found needs that couldn't be met with any existing plugins,\nso I attempted to create my own.This was my first steps into the world of Java - my first \"real\" programming language.A complex dungeon-crawler experience built entirely within Minecraft using custom plugins.\nThis project taught me the fundamentals of Java programming and server-side development.Deepening Skills (2018-2021)After having published a couple of my simple games with GameMaker on itch.io, and one of\nthem amassing 50,000 plays, I decided to take programming a bit more seriously. I had\npurchased GameMaker Studio 2 with the money I had earnt from working at my local McDonald's,\nand I set out to create any game that I could think of.Of course, like all motivation-fueled game-devs, I had a serious case of shiny object syndrome.\nThis meant that throughout my entire time making games, I had only managed to publish onto\nitch.io about 5 of them. I had upwards of 30 projects that lay unfinished, however my\nprogramming skills increased with each game, reinforcing and learning new programming patterns\nso that each game was slightly better & cleaner than the last.One of my early GameMaker games reached 50,000 plays on itch.io, giving me confidence\nto pursue programming more seriously.While I suffered from \"shiny object syndrome\" and left many projects unfinished, each\nattempt taught me valuable programming patterns and improved my code quality.Professional Development (2019-Present)During school and for my first couple years in University, I worked at McDonald's. I\nenjoyed the high-pace environment, and the community at McDonald's, I managed to build\nlife-long friendships with my co-workers. I attained the role of Crew Trainer, and did\nsome professional development with the McDonald's office to improve my coaching ability,\nwhich went hand-in-hand with my other job after school, Badminton Coach.Advanced to Crew Trainer role with professional development training from McDonald's corporate.I started studying Computer Science in 2021. I've always known - well at least since I\nwas 10 - that I wanted to be a programmer. My family was always very supportive of my\naspirations (my father especially, as he had already been working in this field for most\nof his life).University has helped me to formalise my knowledge, and gain a deeper understanding of\nthe lower-level and foundations of programming. Before University, I only really felt\nconfident in a couple languages, the ones that I had spent years working with; but now\nI believe I could pick up any new language within a day - and be able to write\nprofessional-level code within a week.My father, already working in the tech field, provided invaluable guidance and support\nthroughout my programming journey.At the beginning of University, I found the programming courses relatively easy, so I\ndecided to start thinking about how I could earn some money off programming, as that was\nmy end goal - to be able to support myself by doing what I love.I did some market research (watching developer influencers on youtube), and decided that\nfront-end programming was pretty important in the workforce, and that was a sector of\nprogramming that I had never indulged in. I felt confident enough in my backend skills -\ndue to my experience with Java and the development of my gm-server library, that I decided\nthe best course of action would be for me to just dip my toes in web-dev.Needless to say, I fell in love with the Web Development world, and it's become my\nfavourite area of programming.Web development became my primary focus and favorite area of programming, shifting\nmy career trajectory toward full-stack web development.After my third semester of Uni, and coming out of my first successful tech job, I applied\nto many junior positions in my city. I had learnt enough JavaScript & Java that I thought\nI could land a part-time job over the semester break, and gain some work experience as well.Eventually, I managed to get a job for a local company, which has pretty large operations\nbut a relatively small software team. This job required me to learn PHP - a language that\nI had never looked at, within 2 weeks. My skills & knowledge were put to the test, but I\nmanaged to pick it up in the 2 weeks from the interview and when I started working, and\nwithin my first week I had already pushed some code to the production servers.It was quite interesting moving from web-dev with React & NextJS to just using vanilla\nPHP and JavaScript, no frameworks. This meant we basically had our own hand-rolled\nsolutions for everything.Learned PHP from scratch in 2 weeks and deployed production code within the first week of employment.Working without frameworks taught me to appreciate the fundamentals and understand\nwhat modern frameworks provide under the hood.Major Projects & MilestonesAfter rewriting my Minecraft dungeon-crawler server & plugins twice, I had grown quite\ncomfortable with the Java eco-system, and I set out to make my first large-scale project\n(library). While fooling around with Game Development, I grew a keen interest in multiplayer\ngames, and since all my games were developed with GameMaker, I wanted an easy way to be\nable to manage larger-scale multiplayer games.The project was to write a Java Library that would be able to easily interact with GameMaker\nclients, and operate as a game server for multiplayer games.

Each iteration teaches something new about the problem space, user needs,\nor technical constraints.Cross-Pollination: Skills learned in one domain consistently apply to others.\nLeadership from coaching translates to software team dynamics. Visual composition\nfrom photography improves UI design. Game development networking knowledge applies\nto web API design.Community and Open Source: The projects that have had the most impact are those\nthat solve problems for others, not just myself. Open source contributions and\ncommunity resources create value that extends far beyond the initial effort.Balance of Technical and Creative: The most fulfilling projects combine technical\nchallenges with creative expression or meaningful impact. Pure technical exercises\nare valuable for learning, but projects with purpose and personality are what I\nremember and continue to develop.",

        "content": "A comprehensive showcase of projects spanning game development, web applications,\ndeveloper tools, and creative platforms. Each project represents a milestone in\nmy programming journey and demonstrates different aspects of software development.Active ProjectsGenerate daily & weekly reports of political sittings and distribute them to a user base\nvia a website experience & optional emails.Chamber aims to make political information more accessible by automatically generating\ndigestible reports from parliamentary proceedings and delivering them directly to citizens\nwho want to stay informed about their government's activities.Researched various sources for parliamentary data, including official government APIs,\nweb scraping opportunities, and data availability across different jurisdictions.Build the core system that processes parliamentary data and generates human-readable reportsImplement email subscription system with personalized report deliveryCreate user-friendly web interface for browsing reports and managing subscriptionsThis project represents my belief that technology should be used to increase civic\nengagement and make democracy more accessible to everyday people.Blog site for all things on my creative side - a platform where I explore photography,\npainting, music, and other artistic endeavors alongside my technical work.This project serves as a creative outlet and demonstrates my ability to build content\nmanagement systems while exploring the intersection of technology and art.Exploring how programming and artistic expression can complement and enhance each other.\nMany of the same principles that make good code also make good art: composition,\nbalance, iteration, and attention to detail.Built a responsive gallery system for showcasing photography work with metadata and taggingIntegrate music player for original compositions and coversDocumenting my painting journey with progress photos, technique notes, and reflections.Just like coding, painting is about iteration, learning from mistakes, and gradually\nbuilding more complex skills on top of fundamental techniques.Game Development ProjectsA fast-paced multiplayer 1v1 capture the flag game built with GameMaker and Java backend.\nThis project combines my game development roots with my backend programming skills to\ncreate a competitive multiplayer experience.Studied various multiplayer game architectures, latency compensation techniques,\nand anti-cheat systems to inform the design decisions.Built the game client in GameMaker with smooth movement, responsive controls, and network communicationImplemented authoritative game server in Java with player synchronization and match managementDesign and implement skill-based matchmaking for balanced competitive matchesBuilding multiplayer games presents unique challenges around network synchronization,\nlatency compensation, and maintaining game state consistency across clients.Developer Tools & LibrariesAn open-source framework for interfacing between Java servers and GameMaker: Studio game clients.\nThis project solved a real problem I faced when building multiplayer games and has helped\nother developers in the GameMaker community.Deep dive into GameMaker's networking capabilities, socket implementations, and\ncommunication protocols to design an optimal interface layer.Built the foundational library with robust client-server communication protocolsCreated comprehensive documentation with code examples and getting-started guidesProvide ongoing support to developers using the library and maintain compatibilityThe library has been adopted by multiple independent game developers and has received\npositive feedback from the GameMaker community.This project taught me valuable lessons about API design, documentation, backwards\ncompatibility, and maintaining open source projects.Web Applications & PlatformsA hyper-minimalistic project and task management tool designed specifically for developers.\nAfter multiple iterations and redesigns, I'm currently working on a streamlined version\nthat focuses on simplicity and developer workflow integration.Researching how developers currently manage projects and tasks, what tools they use,\nand where existing solutions fall short of their needs.Exploring why developers often prefer simple, focused tools over feature-heavy alternatives.\nSometimes the best tool is the one that gets out of your way and lets you focus on the work.Narrowed down to core features: project creation, task management, and simple time trackingBuilding a clean, distraction-free interface that prioritizes function over formIntegrate with git repositories, development tools, and common developer workflowsThe goal is to create a tool so simple and intuitive that it becomes invisible -\nhelping developers stay organized without adding cognitive overhead.Backend & Infrastructure ProjectsStack setup for a golang API with bun testing, postgres database, and S3 storage for\nlocal & production environments. This project serves as a template and learning resource\nfor other developers looking to set up similar infrastructure.Comprehensive study of the Go ecosystem, comparing different frameworks, ORMs, and\ndeployment strategies to identify best practices and optimal tool combinations.Set up complete docker-compose environment with Go app, PostgreSQL, and MinIO (S3 compatible storage)Integrated Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations with migrations and schema managementConfigured end-to-end testing pipeline using Bun for fast, reliable test executionCreated comprehensive documentation for deploying the stack to production environmentsThe repository has helped several developers bootstrap their Go API projects and serves\nas a reference for modern Go development practices.This project demonstrates current best practices in API development, including\ncontainerization, type safety, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation.Experimental & Learning ProjectsA project specifically designed to explore the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript\nand experiment with different approaches to state management and task organization.Documented the process of migrating a JavaScript project to TypeScript, including\nchallenges faced, benefits realized, and lessons learned about type safety.Reflecting on the transition from dynamic to static typing, the initial resistance,\nthe gradual appreciation, and ultimately the realization that TypeScript makes\nJavaScript development more enjoyable and productive.Built initial version in vanilla JavaScript to establish baseline functionalitySystematically migrated codebase to TypeScript, adding type definitions and improving code qualityCompared performance, developer experience, and code maintainability between JS and TS versionsThis project solidified my understanding of TypeScript's benefits and gave me practical\nexperience in migrating existing codebases to adopt type safety.Creative & Artistic ProjectsA curated collection of photography work spanning landscapes, street photography,\nand experimental compositions. This creative pursuit complements my technical work\nand provides a different lens for seeing and documenting the world.Continuous learning about composition, lighting, post-processing, and different\nphotographic styles to improve technical and artistic skills.Specialized focus on underwater photography while snorkeling, capturing marine life\nand underwater landscapes. This challenging environment requires special techniques\nand equipment considerations.Underwater photography presents unique challenges: limited light, water refraction,\nmarine life behavior, and equipment protection - similar to debugging complex systems!Select and organize best photographs into cohesive collections for online portfolioShare photography work on Instagram and other platforms to build an audience and get feedbackProfessional DevelopmentLed coaching for 8 different badminton teams at competitive city level, developing\nleadership skills, teaching abilities, and team management experience that directly\ntranslates to software development team dynamics.Studied effective coaching and teaching methodologies, sports psychology, and\nteam motivation techniques to become a more effective leader.Successfully managed and coordinated practice schedules, competitions, and development plans for 8 teamsCreated personalized training programs for players at different skill levels and tracked progressDeveloped game strategies, analyzed opponent patterns, and prepared teams for high-level competitionLed teams to compete successfully at the highest level in local city competitions,\nwith several teams achieving top placements.The leadership and analytical skills developed in sports coaching directly apply to\nsoftware development team leadership and code review processes.Reflection & Future DirectionsLooking across this portfolio of projects, several themes emerge that have shaped my\napproach to software development and creative work:Iteration and Learning: Nearly every project has gone through multiple versions,\nredesigns, or pivots. This isn't failure - it's the natural process of learning and\nimproving. Each iteration teaches something new about the problem space, user needs,\nor technical constraints.Cross-Pollination: Skills learned in one domain consistently apply to others.\nLeadership from coaching translates to software team dynamics. Visual composition\nfrom photography improves UI design. Game development networking knowledge applies\nto web API design.Community and Open Source: The projects that have had the most impact are those\nthat solve problems for others, not just myself. Open source contributions and\ncommunity resources create value that extends far beyond the initial effort.Balance of Technical and Creative: The most fulfilling projects combine technical\nchallenges with creative expression or meaningful impact. Pure technical exercises\nare valuable for learning, but projects with purpose and personality are what I\nremember and continue to develop.Explore how AI tools can enhance development workflows and create new possibilities\nfor creative and productivity applicationsDevelop projects that have positive environmental impact or help others make more\nsustainable technology choicesCreate resources and tools that help other developers learn and grow, building on\nmy experience with documentation and teachingFuture projects will prioritize: meaningful impact, technical excellence, community value,\nand personal growth. The goal is to build things that matter, not just things that work.Time spent curating and documenting this comprehensive project portfolio",

This comprehensive guide walks through the entire\nsetup process, from development environment to production deployment.Compared different serverless platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare) and their\ntrade-offs for Next.js applications, ultimately choosing Cloudflare for its edge\nperformance and cost efficiency.Outlined step-by-step tutorial structure covering environment setup, database configuration,\nORM integration, and deployment processCreated complete, tested code examples that readers can follow along with, including\na sample repository with working implementationVerified the entire deployment process works end-to-end and documented any gotchas\nor common issues readers might encounterThis tutorial has helped numerous developers set up modern web applications with\ntype-safe database operations and edge deployment capabilities.In case you're having trouble getting drizzle migrations to talk to a postgres container\nvia docker-compose.yml, I brain dumped my solution for that exact purpose.This post addresses a specific pain point many developers face when setting up local\ndevelopment environments with containerized databases and ORM migrations.Deep dive into Docker networking, container communication, and common connection\nissues between application containers and database containers.Created minimal reproduction case demonstrating the common connection problems\ndevelopers encounter with this setupDocumented the exact configuration changes and troubleshooting steps needed\nto resolve the connection issuesThis post has saved many developers hours of debugging Docker networking issues\nand has been referenced in various developer communities.Sometimes the most valuable blog posts are simple solutions to specific problems\nthat developers commonly encounter but struggle to find clear answers for.I've made an example stack for easy setup using golang, drizzle, minio, and bun for\nend-to-end testing. I walkthrough some of the decisions I made and the reasoning\nbehind them in this post.This comprehensive guide goes beyond just showing how to set up the stack - it explains\nthe architectural decisions, trade-offs, and reasoning behind each technology choice.Comprehensive analysis of the Go ecosystem for web APIs, comparing frameworks,\nORMs, testing tools, and deployment strategies to identify optimal combinations.Documented the reasoning behind each technology choice, including alternatives\nconsidered and trade-offs evaluatedDeveloped comprehensive testing approach using Bun for fast test execution\nand reliable CI/CD integrationCreated guidance for taking the development stack to production, including\nsecurity considerations and performance optimizationsFull working example with Docker setup, comprehensive tests, and deployment scripts\nthat developers can use as a starting point for their own projects.Providing complete, working examples is often more valuable than theoretical\nexplanations. Developers can learn by running, modifying, and extending real code.Safari & Cross-Browser CompatibilityMaking sure your application works the same across all the different browser engines\ncan be a major pain point in web development. This post tackles a specific Safari\nstyling issue that many developers encounter.Safari's default styling for select elements includes a glossy appearance that can\nclash with modern flat design aesthetics and break visual consistency across browsers.Investigated Safari's WebKit rendering engine differences compared to Chromium\nand Firefox, specifically focusing on form element styling inconsistencies.Created visual examples showing the inconsistency between browsers and the\nspecific appearance issues with Safari's default select stylingDeveloped and tested CSS solutions that maintain functionality while achieving\nconsistent appearance across all major browsersEnsured the solution maintains accessibility standards and doesn't break\nkeyboard navigation or screen reader compatibilityThis solution has been widely shared in developer communities and helped solve\na common frustration point for web developers dealing with Safari quirks.While it's tempting to ignore Safari given its smaller market share, providing\nconsistent experiences across all browsers is part of being a professional web developer.Developer Insights & Career AdviceLessons Show Off Your Work Force Yourself To Finish Stick to one stack Document your...A reflective piece looking back on my programming journey and identifying the key\ninsights that would have accelerated my growth if I had understood them earlier.\nThis post resonates with developers at all stages of their careers.Analyzed common patterns in developer career progression, both from personal\nexperience and by observing other developers' journeys in the community.Early in my career, I built many projects but rarely shared them publicly.\nThis was a missed opportunity for feedback, networking, and career advancement.\nBuilding in public and sharing your work is one of the fastest ways to grow\nas a developer and connect with the community.The temptation to jump to new, exciting projects before finishing the current\none is strong, but completing projects teaches crucial skills: dealing with\nthe \"boring\" parts, polishing details, and understanding what it really means\nto ship software to users.While it's valuable to be aware of different technologies, constantly switching\nframeworks and languages prevents you from developing deep expertise. Pick\na stack and master it before exploring alternatives.Writing about what you learn reinforces the knowledge and creates a valuable\nresource for your future self and other developers. Blog posts, notes, and\ntutorials help solidify understanding and build your reputation.Programming can feel isolating, but the developer community is incredibly\nwelcoming and helpful. Participating in forums, contributing to open source,\nand attending events accelerates learning and creates opportunities.This post gained significant traction in the developer community and sparked\ndiscussions about career development strategies across multiple platforms.Some of the most valuable content comes from honest reflection on mistakes\nand lessons learned. Vulnerability in sharing struggles helps other developers\nfeel less alone in their journey.Project Development LogsA multi-part blog series documenting the development, redesign, and evolution\nof DevPad - a minimalistic project management tool for developers. This series\nprovides transparency into the development process and design decisions.Following on from my last update, the new redesign is coming along nicely, along\nwith finally implementing some of the core functionality. Future plans to open\nsource part of the application are described, and a roadmap for initial release\nis laid out.Implemented the fundamental features: project creation, task management, and basic time trackingPlanning which parts of the application to open source and how to structure the codebase for community contributionsRegular development updates help maintain accountability and allow the community\nto follow along with the design and implementation decisions.It's been a while since I've worked on devpad, and I've forgotten exactly how\nthe system is setup. Trying to use this application has brought to life many\nlimitations of the hyper-minimalist vanilla html feel.Explored the tension between minimalist design principles and practical usability,\nfinding the right balance between simplicity and functionality.Enhanced the interface while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic, focusing on clarity and user experienceSometimes taking a break from a project provides valuable perspective on its\nstrengths and weaknesses. Fresh eyes often reveal obvious improvements.After running into some issues synchronising the session across 2 different servers,\nI rethink why I have these servers split up in the first place.Analyzed the complexity introduced by splitting the application across multiple\nservers and evaluated whether the separation was providing real benefits.Consolidated the application architecture to reduce complexity and eliminate session synchronization issuesSometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. Premature optimization and\nover-engineering can create problems that don't need to exist.Language & Framework ExplorationA two-part series documenting the transition of a project from JavaScript to TypeScript,\nexploring the practical benefits and challenges of adopting static typing.In this log, I'll delve into specific coding challenges and solutions encountered\nwhile developing the todo-tracker in vanilla JavaScript.Explored modern JavaScript patterns, module systems, and state management\napproaches without relying on frameworks or build tools.Designed a clean, maintainable architecture using only JavaScript language features\nand web APIsBuilding without frameworks forces you to understand the underlying web platform\nand browser APIs, providing valuable insights into what frameworks do for you.As part of the todo-tracker project, I transitioned the project from JavaScript\nto TypeScript, documenting the process, challenges, and benefits discovered along the way.Researched best practices for migrating existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript,\nincluding incremental adoption strategies and tooling setup.Systematically added type annotations, interfaces, and type safety throughout\nthe codebase while maintaining functionalityThe migration caught several potential bugs and made the codebase significantly\nmore maintainable and self-documenting.The transition to TypeScript was smoother than expected and provided immediate\nbenefits in terms of code quality and developer experience.Community Contributions & Open SourceA while ago I started a large-scale project that I intended to be able to use myself\nto manage both my coding projects & university assignments. This post documents the\ndecision to significantly reduce scope and focus on core functionality.Analyzed how feature creep and scope expansion had made the project unwieldy\nand difficult to complete, leading to the decision to dramatically simplify.Identified the core 20% of features that would provide 80% of the value\nand eliminated everything else from the initial releaseLearning to say \"no\" to features and focus on the essential functionality\nis one of the most important skills for completing projects successfully.Writing & Documentation PhilosophyMy approach to technical writing is rooted in the belief that writing about something\nis one of the best ways to truly understand it. When you have to explain a concept\nclearly to others, you're forced to examine your own understanding and fill in any gaps.Exploring the connection between writing and learning, and how the process of\narticulating ideas helps solidify understanding and reveal knowledge gaps.Good documentation should be treated with the same care and attention as code.\nIt should be clear, maintainable, up-to-date, and provide real value to users.The most satisfying blog posts are those that solve real problems for other\ndevelopers.
